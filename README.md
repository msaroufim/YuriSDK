# Yuri SDK

Yuri is agnostic to the language you built your game in. If you don't see an interface in the language you're working with, please open an issue and let us know, it shouldn't take more than 1/2 a day to produce an example. Yuri has already been tested in the following languages.
* [C++ SDK](Yuri.h)
* [C# SDK](Yuri.cs)
* [Python SDK](Yuri.py)

Adhering to the interface means your game can now use Reinforcement Learning algorithms to train agents in your game. Contact me and we can start the cloud training ASAP. http://www.yuri.ai

If you have trouble adhering to the interface then I can also help you set it up.
